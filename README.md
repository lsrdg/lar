## Keep your Archlinux home clean

The Archwiki has a page about [System
Maintenance](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/System_maintenance#Partial_upgrades_are_unsupported).

This script will (in theory) just give you the same informations that you get on
the wiki. However, in instead of just give you the text, the script will test
your patience by asking if you wanna the blue or the red pill.

*Lar* is written in [Lua](http://lua.org/), ("l" from "lua", "ar" from "arch").
By the way, it means "home" in portuguese. Whatever, this script is just an
excuse to learn Lua and eventually be able to use it with
[Neovim](http://neovim.io/). o/
